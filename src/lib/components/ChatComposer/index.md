# ChatComposer

A headless wrapper for a chat input form with a text area that grows with its content, sends on Enter, and turns its send button into a stop button while a reply is in progress.

## Canonical documentation

See [components/chat-composer/index.md](../../../../../components/chat-composer/index.md) for the full component documentation: keyboard, ARIA, props and guidance.

## Usage

```svelte
<ChatComposer label="Message" sendLabel="Send" stopLabel="Stop" bind:value={draft} busy={replying} onSend={send} onStop={cancel} />
```

## Contract

A `<form class="chat-composer">` with a named `<textarea>` and one send/stop button; Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a line break, IME Enter is ignored; the button is disabled, never hidden, when empty; no string, animation or clearing of the text.
